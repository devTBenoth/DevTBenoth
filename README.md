  My name is Berkay Karako√ß. I am a 16 year old 11th grade high school student interested in Binary Exploitation and Malware Analysis in Linux Environment.
  <br> <br>
  Although I am not a professional in the fields I am interested in, I am trying to improve myself. At the same time, I share what I have learned about this field on my <a href="https://devtbenoth.github.io"> github.io </a> page for other people to learn.
